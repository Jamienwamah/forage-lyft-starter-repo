This is an lyft open source project, in which i redesigned the software architecture of the component. 
Listed below are the various tasks i did

In task 1, I drafted a newly designed architecture for your component;
In task 2, I refactored the messy codebase; and
In task 3, I introduced unit tests for my newly refactored system.
In this final task, i was asked to add some new functionality to the system. I will be using a test-driven development workflow - often abbreviated TDD - to make the changes.

TDD is a hybrid workflow that combines testing, coding and refactoring, where you constantly bounce back and forth between writing code and writing test cases for it. The workflow encourages good habits, helps you consider all possible edge cases, and leads to a robust, comprehensive test suite upon completion of the project.
